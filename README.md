# Stock-Market-Monitor

Program made with python made to monitor the price of the stock market.
To start monitoring a stock, enter the ticker in the first box. In the second box, enter the price at which you want to be alerted. For example, if you enter the target price "TSLA" in the first box and the price "460" in the second box, the program will play a tone and open a pop-up window to notify you that that price has been reached. If the price has not yet been reached, you will be shown the ticker name, the current price (which is updated every minute), and the price the ticker must reach to send you the alert.

!IMPORTANT! 
To make the program work you have to insert your twelvedata apikey. If you don't already have one you can register on the website https://twelvedata.com/ and substitute the string assigned to the ```APIKEY``` constant with your api key.
